# Threads-and-Singleton
Individual Lab

After code is running I notice the hashCode seems to be the integer associated with the singleton we created. 
The Runnable01 is used to generate different threads within a span we create. For this example the span is 1-10 with it
being random which threads are created. Overall very useful. I couldn't tell if we were supposed to make a Runnable01 
that would take the hashCode and create threads with that but I did not know how to complete that so I just made them 
separate.
